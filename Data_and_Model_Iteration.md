## Questions     
1. Perform feature engineering 
    - For Neural Nets a large amount of traditional feature engineering is largely unnecessary. The benefit of the myriad of non-lienar connections allow the NN to learn 'features' and deprioritize the less useful features. Its one of the strengths of NN, but typically is the reason why larger datasets are necessary. For our particular use case, if you squint you could consider the image augmentation used in the simclr model to be like feature engineering. This augmentation is found in $get_augmenter$ function  (https://github.com/jenningst/fourthbrain-capstone/blob/main/simclr_test/simclr%20model%20V2.ipynb - cell 6) and can be seen to affect image crop, view, brightness, and color.

2. Retrain models and tune hyperparameter 
    - For our project prompt, we have a model reported in a paper () trained on 1000 images with an accuracy of 93%. This bench mark is compared to 2 models developed by our team, a transfer learning inceptionV3 also trained on 1000 images and a student net created via the simclr method trained on 20k unlabeled images and the same 1000 labeled images. 
    - In these methods finetuning takes a specific form
        - for transfer learning finetuning occurs in the final FC layer with frozen weights, our limited model achieves a validation accuracy of ~90% after 10 epochs 
        - for our student net finetuning occurs after the teacher net encoder, which utilizes a base resnet50 architecture, again at the output layer. This model achieves a maximum validation accuracy of 96.5% in 20 epochs and a maximum validation accuracy of 100% after 100 epochs.

3. Leverage AutoML to benchmark your model
    - since we're already comparing multiple models we've decided not to explore AutoML Vision, but we'd expect the results to be similar to the transfer learning.
